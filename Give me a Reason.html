<span class="girl">Right from the start you were a thief, you stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me that weren’t all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them

Now you’ve been talking in your sleep, oh-oh
Things you never say to me, oh-oh
Tell me that you’ve had enough of our love, our love

Just give me a reason, just a little bit’s enough
Just a second, we’re not broken just bent, and we can learn to love again
It’s in the stars, it’s been written in the scars on our hearts
We’re not broken, just bent, and we can learn to love again

</span><span class="guy">I’m sorry I don’t understand where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine </span><span class="girl">(Oh, we had everything)
</span><span class="guy">Your head is running wild again, my dear, we still have everythin’
And it’s all in your mind </span><span class="girl">(Yeah, but this is happenin’)

</span><span class="guy">You’ve been havin’ real bad dreams, oh-oh
Used to lie so close to me, oh-oh
</span><span class="both">There’s nothing more than empty sheets between our love, our love
</span><span class="guy">Oh, </span><span class="both">our love, our love

</span><span class="both">Just give me a reason, just a little bit’s enough
Just a second, we’re not broken just bent, and we can learn to love again
</span><span class="guy">I never stop, you’re still written in the scars on my heart
</span><span class="both">You’re not broken, just bent, and we can learn to love again

</span><span class="girl">Oh, tear ducts and rust, </span><span class="guy">I’ll fix it for us
</span><span class="girl">We’re collecting dust, </span><span class="guy">but our love’s enough
You’re holding it in, </span><span class="girl">you’re pouring a drink
</span><span class="guy">No, nothing is as bad as it seems, </span><span class="girl">we’ll come clean

</span><span class="both">Just give me a reason, just a little bit’s enough
Just a second, we’re not broken just bent, and we can learn to love again
It’s in the stars, it’s been written in the scars on our hearts
That we’re not broken, just bent, and we can learn to love again

Just give me a reason, just a little bit’s enough
Just a second, we’re not broken just bent, and we can learn to love again
It’s in the stars, it’s been written in the scars on our hearts
That we’re not broken, just bent, and we can learn to love again

</span><span class="girl">Oh, can learn to love again
Oh, can learn to love again, oh-oh
That we’re not broken, just bent, so we can learn to love again</span>
